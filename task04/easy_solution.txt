You need to create a sequence of moves consisted of the allowed words:
UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT
The words can repeat.

The sequence you create should be based on the description of the moves in the user message.
Your response should contain ONLY the JSON object with the sequence. Do not include any additional text or explanation. The JSON object should look like this:

{"steps": "your sequence here"}

The description:
Go twice upwards, then twice to the right side, then go downwards twice, and then go right three times.
